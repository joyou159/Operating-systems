<h1 style="color:white">  &#9658 <u> definition of operating systems</u> </h1> 
<p style="color:white"> 
An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer.
 It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. 
 It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.
 Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

<p style="color:white"> 
Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy.
 Most people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems.
 The three most common operating systems for personal computers are:
 <ul style="color:white">
  <li>microsoft windows &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a href="Microsoft windows.html"  > click here for more details </a>
  <li>macOS &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a href="macos.html"  >click here for more delails </a>
  <li>Linux &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a href= "Linux.html"  >click here for more details </a>
</ul>

<p style="color:white">
Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey).
 A GUI lets you use your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of graphics and text.
Each operating system's GUI has a different look and feel, so if you switch to a different operating system it may seem unfamiliar at first.
 However, modern operating systems are designed to be easy to use, and most of the basic principles are the same.

<h3 style="color:white">&#9658 <u> Operating systems for mobile devices </u> &#9664 </h3>
<p style="color:white"> 
The operating systems we've been talking about so far were designed to run on desktop and laptop computers. 
Mobile devices such as phones, tablet computers, and MP3 players are different from desktop and laptop computers, so they run operating systems that are designed specifically for mobile devices.
 Examples of mobile operating systems include:  
 
<ul style="color:white">
  <li>Google Android </li>
  <li>Apple iOS</li>
</ul>  
<p style="color:white">
Operating systems for mobile devices generally aren't as fully featured as those made for desktop and laptop computers, and they aren't able to run all of the same software. 
However, you can still do a lot of things with them, like watch movies, browse the Web, manage your calendar, and play games.
