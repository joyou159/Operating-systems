<h2> &#9658 <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantages of windows operating system</span></strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Support for all hardware:</strong> As windows OS is used by 95% of users so most of the hardware vendors make
drivers for windows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> All
versions of Microsoft Windows have something common in it which makes users easy
to shift from one version to another. Windows 7 users have no difficulty in
migrating to Windows 10 because most of the features of Windows 10 are the same
as windows 7. The user interface of windows is also easy to use than UNIX and MAC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software support:</strong> Windows platform is best suited for game and software developers. Windows have
large number audience so developers prefer to make utilities, games and
software for windows OS. Linux users cannot make windows apps so it is better
to use windows for developing apps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plug and play feature:</strong> Most hardware can be detected automatically by plug and play feature. You do
not need to manually install the hardware but it is ready to use when attached
e.g. webcam, keyboard, mouse, mobile device etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Desktop and touch screen:</strong> Windows 10 is made for both touch screen devices and desktop computers. The user
interface of Windows 10 is made in such a way that it works better for any type
of windows device.</p></li>

<h2> &#9658 <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disadvantages of Windows operating system</span></strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Virus attacks:</strong> Windows
have a high amount of hacker attacks. The hackers can easily break windows
security. So windows users are dependent on anti-virus software and have to pay
monthly charges to companies to protect their data. Also, windows users have to
update OS to keep up-to-date with security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most of the software is paid:</strong> Most windows programs are paid e.g. games, graphics software (Photoshop),
download manager (IDM) and other popular software are paid. You have to buy these
software or pay a monthly fee to use them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rebooting a system:</strong> If
your system becomes slow in performance then you have to reboot it. If you load
many programs at the same time then your system slows down and hangs up. The
only solution for this is to reboot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High price:</strong> Linux OS
is open source and is free to use for everyone but windows OS has paid license
and you cannot use windows OS legally free. The cost of buying a copy of
windows OS is high as well. You also need to buy other Microsoft software e.g.
MS Office to do regular office work on the computer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High computer resources:</strong> If you are installing windows OS then your computer should have high ram
capacity, a lot of hard drive space and good graphics card. This is because of
features that are used in windows. If you want to install graphics software
i.e. Photoshop then 16 GB of ram is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical support:</strong> Windows support is not good for most users. Only some large organizations can get good support from the windows team. Common users have to search for forums to get their problem solved.</p></li>
